# Data-Science-Project-FA2025

### 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Amazon product reviews** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict customer sentiment. It was developed as part of the **Data Science Society DeCal (FA25)** at UC Berkeley, focusing on practical applications of data cleaning, model evaluation, and visualization.

### 🧠 Objectives  
- Preprocess and clean text data using **NLTK** and **BeautifulSoup**  
- Perform **sentiment classification** using logistic regression and other supervised models  
- Visualize review score distributions and classification performance  
- Evaluate model accuracy with metrics such as **F1-score, precision, and recall**  

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **NLTK** (stopwords, VADER sentiment analysis)  
- **BeautifulSoup** (text cleaning)  
- **Deepnote** for collaborative development  
- **GitHub** for version control  

### 📁 Files  
- `Notebook1.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook (data cleaning, EDA, model training)  
- `Reviews.csv`: Dataset containing Amazon product reviews  
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for reproducibility  

### 🚀 Key Results  
- Implemented logistic regression model achieving strong sentiment prediction accuracy  
- Identified key linguistic patterns correlating with positive and negative reviews  
- Visualized review distributions and classifier performance for interpretability
